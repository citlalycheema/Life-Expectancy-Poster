# Life-Expectancy-Poster

This is an example of a poster I created as part of a project for a Data Analysis course at American University in Spring 2023. The assignment asked us to find a dataset and use it to ask and answer an empirical question using appropriate data and statistical analysis. The assignment required us to present this in a poster.

This poster analyzes the different factors that impact life expectancy and specifically looks at the relationship of the following key variables: years of schooling, total expenditure on health, and immuniaztion coverage for polio. In preparing the poster, I first drafted my empiral questions, renamed the variables I wanted to analyze to make them more user-friendly, conducted summary statistics, and then I ran linear regressions for each of the key variables (years of schooling, total expenditure on health, immunization coverage for polio). To conclude the poster,I outlined the findings and concluded thatthe relationship between the variables and life expectancy were not statistically significant. The data was downloaded from Kaggle, but was originally pulledthe WHO data repository website, as well as economic data collected from the United Nation website.

Files for the project:

- `df1.RData` replication data
- `life_expectancy_poster.Rmd` code for creating the slides
- `index.html` with the output
